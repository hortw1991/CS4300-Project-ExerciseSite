# General Notes

* Switching from build a plan to an article section is probably easier than
  having the users have to search and switch.  Instead we could just have the
  users favorite exercises/workouts they like
* Nothing says we have to register users so I changed it to an about.  We 
  meet our quota of dynamic and interactive pages in both searching for workouts,
  exercises, and articles.

## Bootstrap Info

If we use bootstrap, we have to dynamically generate content with their preset
information.  This isn't really a problem but it's a little more text than
just class="article".
