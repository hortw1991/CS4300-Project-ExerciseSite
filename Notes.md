# General Notes

* Decide how we want to select workouts / exercises.  Do we just select from a dropdown?

The main way the website functions is the user should go to "exercises, workouts, or articles".
From there, they can select an individual item that will lead them to the individual-x.html
page.





## Bootstrap Info

If we use bootstrap, we have to dynamically generate content with their preset
information.  This isn't really a problem but it's a little more text than
just class="article".
