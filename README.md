# CS4300-Project-ExerciseSite
CS4300 Final Project

## Overview

This was the final project for CS4300 at UGA and is intended to be a simple site containing exercises made of subcomponents that join together to form workouts.  

Unfortunately, it was not able to be fully implemented due to the COVID19 outbreak.

The "exercises" page is fully implemented as proof of concept and can be run in and JSP engine.
